Steamodd is a project that grew out of a 200 line test script I
wrote to test out the new API and find stuff I could complain about.

There are still some hacky spots but overall the modules should be
usable in a project.

Before most of the functions will complete successfully you will need to
call steam.set_api_key and pass your key to it.

If you don't have an API key it's easy to register for one at
http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
